# Building-the-LinkedIn-Profile-Fetching-with-AI-Agent
small project, our agent will use two main tools to search for LinkedIn profiles based on user input: the GoogleSearch tool from Phidata and the Tavily Search API. 

The GoogleSearch tool will help our agent perform a quick search on Google, specifically looking for LinkedIn profiles. The Tavily Search API, on the other hand, will enable our agent to make more specific searches within LinkedIn, pulling results directly from the API. We’ll combine these tools into a LangChain agent, which will be able to search the web and fetch the most relevant LinkedIn profile link when a user provides a name.

 Groq LLM (a large language model) called llama-3.3–70b-versatile is set up to handle the AI tasks.
